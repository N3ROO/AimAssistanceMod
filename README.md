A minecraft mod that helps aiming (at mods, blocks, but not players). Made for newbies or disabled players with difficulties to aim in general.

## Disclamer

**The mod has been designed to simplify the gameplay of people with disabilities**.

If you play online, make sure that the server allows the use of this mod. It won't work on
other players anyway, so it won't give you a PvP advantage. Also, the server owner can easily
blacklist this mod by blacklisting its id ("aimassistancemod"). I am not responsible for any
misuse of this mod.
