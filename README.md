## Disclamer

**The mod has been designed to simplify the gameplay of people with disabilities**.

If you play online, make sure that the server allows the use of this mod.
It will only works on mobs anyway. Also, the server owner can easily blacklist
this mod by blacklisting its id ("aimassistancemod"). I am not responsible for any
misuse of this mod. You have been warned.
